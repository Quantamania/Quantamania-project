# Quantamania-project

## Task
<h4>
  
  `
  Your mission is to craft a simulation that leverages quantum-inspired techniques to replicate the intricate interplay between mass and momentum as dictated by Newtonian physics. Through this simulation, you'll unlock the secrets behind mass and momentum conversion, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the universe's most enigmatic phenomena â€“ black holes, neutron stars, and dark matter.
